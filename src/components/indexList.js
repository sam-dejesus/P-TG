    title:'Electricity',
    description:'Electricity is a form of energy that moves through wires and powers things like lights, phones, and TVs. It works by the flow of tiny particles called electrons, which move through a material, usually a metal wire. This flow is called an electric current. Electricity can come from power plants, batteries, or even the sun. It needs a complete path, called a circuit, to flow properly. When you flip a light switch, you are closing the circuit and letting the electricity flow to turn the light on. Electricity is used all around us to power machines, devices, and even entire cities.',

    title:'Electric Motors',
    description:'An electric motor is a machine that turns electricity into movement. It works by using magnets and electric current to create a force that makes something spin. Inside the motor, when electricity flows through a wire coil, it creates a magnetic field. This field pushes against other magnets in the motor, causing the coil to spin. That spinning motion can then be used to power things like fans, washing machines, or electric cars. Electric motors are important because they can do work quietly, efficiently, and without needing fuel like gas or oil.',

    title:'Gears',
    description:'Gears are wheels with teeth that fit together and turn each other to control movement. When one gear turns, it causes the other to turn as well. If a small gear turns a larger one, the larger gear moves more slowly but with more force. On the other hand, if a large gear turns a smaller one, the smaller gear spins faster but with less force. Gears are used in many machines, like bikes, cars, and clocks, to change speed, direction, or the amount of force.',

    title:'Gearboxes',
    description:'A gearbox is a system of gears working together inside a casing to control the speed and force of movement in a machine. It lets you switch between different gear combinations to make something go faster, slower, or handle more load. For example, in a car, the gearbox helps the engine work efficiently by giving more power when starting or going uphill, and higher speed when cruising. By changing gears, the gearbox adjusts how much force is sent to the wheels without changing how fast the engine runs.',

    description:'Simple machines are basic tools that make work easier by helping us move or lift things with less effort. There are six main types: the lever, wheel and axle, pulley, inclined plane, screw, and wedge. Each one changes the way force is usedâ€”either by increasing it, changing its direction, or spreading it out.',
